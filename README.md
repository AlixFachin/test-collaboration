# Test of collaboration with GitHub

## Objective
The objective is to get practice in a collaborative environment with Git, Github, branching, merging, ...

## How does it work
Feel free to fork the repo, and modify it the way you want, branch it with a decent name, and then send a pull request to see how it actually works to collaborate.

Thanks in advance!
